- 👋 Hi, I’m @jlbarletta11
- 👀 I’m interested in math, AI, Python on finantials. I normally follows economic and finantial forus, and as a hobby I develop my own finantial controls and apps
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (I already spent a lot of time on statistics and math) and, in parallel, creating my own projects (until today, locally)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finantial models, math, Python and AI applied on finance.
